# LuigiTonnaro
Repo for LuigiTonnaro, an homebrewed Discord bot.

This repo includes a "libs" folder that includes some custom modified python libraries. These libraries should be deployed in a virtual environment, overwriting the publicly available ones.

Discord.py package should be installed with voice support(discord[voice]).

Bring your own ffmpeg executable and place it into the bin directory.

Bring your own sounds in mp3 format and place them into the sounds directory. Configure which sounds you want to play by editing the first lines of the script.
